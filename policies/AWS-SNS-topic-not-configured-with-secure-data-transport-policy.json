  "description": "This policy identifies AWS SNS topics that are not configured with a secure data transport policy. AWS SNS topics should enforce encryption of data in transit using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It is recommended to add an SNS policy that explicitly denies (Effect: Deny) publish access (Action: SNS:Publish) from anybody who browses (Principal: *) to Amazon SNS topics if they are not accessed through HTTPS (aws:SecureTransport: false).\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-security-best-practices.html#enforce-encryption-data-in-transit",
