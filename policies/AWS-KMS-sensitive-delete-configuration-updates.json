  "description": "This policy identifies AWS KMS entities that have permission for sensitive delete configuration updates such as KMS Key deletion, deletion of imported key materials and deletion alias. Changing the KMS configuration by unauthorized users may leave cloud workloads in a vulnerable state and it is important that security teams have visibility into and get alerted when sensitive KMS operations are performed.",

  "recommendation": "1. Log in to AWS Console and make sure that the user indeed had the permissions to make the changes to the configuration that were reported.\n2. Make sure that the configuration changes do not put the cloud resources in a vulnerable state.\n3. If the user was not supposed to perform the reported changes, make sure that the KMS policy is modified such that the only user has minimal permissions to perform normal job function.",
