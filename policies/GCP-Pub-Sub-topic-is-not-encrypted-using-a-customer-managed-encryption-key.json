It is a best practice to use customer-managed KMS Keys to encrypt your Pub/Sub topic. Customer-managed CMKs give you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotate, disable, define access control for, and audit the encryption keys used to help protect your data.\n\nReference: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/encryption ",
