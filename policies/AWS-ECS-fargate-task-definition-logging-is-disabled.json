  "description": "This policy identifies ECS fargate task definitions for which logging is disabled. You can configure the containers in your tasks to send log information to CloudWatch Logs to help you get information from running containers and services. If you are using the Fargate launch type for your tasks, this allows you to view the logs from your containers. This policy checks the logging configuration of your task definition and alerts if logging is not enabled.",
