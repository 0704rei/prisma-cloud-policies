This combination of permissions allows the instance to retrieve sensitive secrets from Secrets Manager and decrypt encrypted data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). If unauthorized access or compromise occurs, it could lead to unauthorized retrieval of secrets or decryption of sensitive data, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system.",
