It is recommended to upgrade the OpenSSL version to the latest version and limit exposure to the internet.\n\nFor details:\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3602\n\nNOTE: This policy is effective only when Prisma Compute is enabled in your environment.",

Review the identified instance and investigate the network traffic to make sure that there is sufficient volume of egress traffic to indicate a compromise.\n3. Log in to the host machine and make sure that there are no processes running that indicate a potential compromise.\n4. If this instance is not authorized to process or host OpenSSL related services then terminate the services and change the ACL to block the outgoing traffic.\n5. If this instance is authorized to use OpenSSL related services then upgrade OpenSSL to the latest version to fix this vulnerability.",
