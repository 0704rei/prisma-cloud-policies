Log in to the AWS console\n2. Navigate to the IAM service\n3. Click on Users\n4. Choose the relevant user\n5. Under 'Permissions policies', find the relevant policy according to the alert details and remove the risky actions\n----------------------------------------\nRemediation for a Compute instance/Okta user that assumes a role:\n1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. Navigate to the compute service (For example, AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, or AWS ECS) or login to the Okta console\n3. Find the role used by the compute instance/Okta user\n4. Navigate to the IAM service\n5. Click on Roles\n6. Choose the relevant role\n7. Under 'Permissions policies', find the relevant policy according to the alert details and remove the risky actions\n----------------------------------------\nRemediation for a Resource-based Policy:\n1.
