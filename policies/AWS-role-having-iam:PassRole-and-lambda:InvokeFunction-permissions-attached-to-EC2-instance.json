  "description": "This IAM policy is meticulously designed to address potential vulnerabilities arising from an AWS EC2 instance with specific permissions. The 'iam:PassRole' action, coupled with 'lambda:CreateFunction' and 'lambda:InvokeFunction', holds the potential for adversaries to exploit and escalate privileges. By strategically controlling access to these actions within the 'ec2' service, this policy effectively mitigates the risk of unauthorized creation and manipulation of Lambda functions, safeguarding against potential escalation of privileges and maintaining the integrity of your system.",
