Boot Diagnostics when enabled for the virtual machine, captures a Screenshot and Console Output during virtual machine startup. This would help in troubleshooting the virtual machine when it enters a non-bootable state.\n\nFor details refer:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/boot-diagnostics\n\nNOTE: We are excluding Databricks virtual machines (Azure-managed solutions) in reporting as Boot Diagnostic setting can not be enabled on those.",
