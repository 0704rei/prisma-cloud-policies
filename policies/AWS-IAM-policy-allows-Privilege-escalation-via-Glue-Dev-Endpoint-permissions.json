  "description": "With access to the glue:UpdateDevEndpoint permission, an adversary can update the existing SSH key associated with the glue endpoint. This will allow the adversary to SSH into the host and gain access to IAM credentials associated with the role attached to the glue endpoint. Though not required, it may be helpful to have the glue:GetDevEndpoint permission as well, if the existing endpoint cannot be identified via other means.",

Follow these recommendations:\n\nFor the iam:PassRole policy statement section:\n- Use the AWS pass-to service condition to only the service the role is being passed.\n- Reduce and, if possible, eliminate the usage of * in the resource section by scoping to a single role\n\nFor the allowed services actions policy statement section:\n- Reduce and, if possible, eliminate the usage of * in the resource section by scoping to a single resource or small group of resources\n\nRemediation for a user:\n1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. Navigate to the IAM service\n3. Click on Users\n4. Choose the relevant user\n5. Under 'Permissions policies', find the relevant policy according to the alert details and remove the risky actions\n----------------------------------------\nRemediation for a Compute instance/Okta user that assumes a role:\n1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. Navigate to the compute service (For example, AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, or AWS ECS) or login to the Okta console\n3. Find the role used by the compute instance/Okta user\n4. Navigate to the IAM service\n5. Click on Roles\n6. Choose the relevant role\n7. Under 'Permissions policies', find the relevant policy according to the alert details and remove the risky actions\n----------------------------------------\nRemediation for a Resource-based Policy:\n1.
