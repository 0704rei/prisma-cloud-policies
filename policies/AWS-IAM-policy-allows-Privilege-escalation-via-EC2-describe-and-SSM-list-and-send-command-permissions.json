If identity requires the use of these permissions to pass a role to an EC2 instance, make sure the policy is scoped to only the resources needed. The same granular logic can be applied with EC2 as the following example using the lambda function. https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/granular-access-lambda/\n\nRemediation steps:\n1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. Navigate to the EC2 instance\n3. Find the role used by the EC2 instance\n4. Navigate to the IAM service\n5. Click on Roles\n6. Choose the relevant role\n7.
