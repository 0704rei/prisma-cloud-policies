  "description": "With access to the iam:PassRole, lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping, and lambda:CreateFunction permissions, an adversary can create a Lambda function with an existing more privileged role and associating it with a DynamoDB table. Then, when a new record is inserted into the table, the Lambda function will trigger with the privilege of the passed in role. This would allow an adversary to escalate privileges to the more privileged role.",
