  "description": "This IAM policy tackles potential vulnerabilities linked to an AWS EC2 instance equipped with an IAM role that confers access to the 'secretsmanager:GetSecretValue' and 'kms:Decrypt' actions. By closely managing permissions within the 'ec2' service, this policy guards against unauthorized retrieval of sensitive secrets from Secrets Manager and unauthorized decryption of encrypted data through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This strategic control ensures the safeguarding of system confidentiality and integrity, mitigating risks associated with potential unauthorized access or compromise.",
