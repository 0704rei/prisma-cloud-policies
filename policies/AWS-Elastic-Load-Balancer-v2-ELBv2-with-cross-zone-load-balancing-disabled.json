  "description": "This policy identifies load balancers that do not have cross-zone load balancing enabled.\n\nCross-zone load balancing evenly distributes incoming traffic across healthy targets in all availability zones. This can help to ensure your application can manage additional traffic and limit the risk of any single availability zone getting overwhelmed and perhaps affecting load balancer performance.\n\nIt is recommended to enable cross-zone load balancing.",
