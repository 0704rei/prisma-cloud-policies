  "description": "This policy identifies GCP storage buckets that are not configured with default Event-Based Hold. An event-based hold resets the object's time in the bucket for the purposes of the retention period. This behavior is useful when you want an object to persist in your bucket for a certain length of time after a certain event occurs. It is recommended to enable this feature to protect individual objects from deletion.\n\nReference: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-holds",
